Mushroom Classification Project
This project utilizes a dataset of mushroom samples to build a machine learning model that classifies mushrooms based on features such as cap shape, odor, gill size, and more. The dataset includes descriptions of 23 species from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, as presented in The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is labeled as either edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility, with unknown cases grouped with the poisonous class. Note that the Guide emphasizes the absence of a straightforward rule for determining a mushroom's edibility, underscoring the importance of accurate classification.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to train a classification model to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on several descriptive features. This could potentially serve as an educational tool or assist in mushroom foraging applications.

Dataset Description
Source: The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981)
Number of Species: 23 species from the Agaricus and Lepiota family
Class Labels: Edible, Poisonous (includes unknown edibility)
Features: Cap shape, cap color, gill size, odor, spore print color, etc.
The dataset lacks a simple rule for identifying poisonous mushrooms, contrasting it with easily identifiable plants like Poison Oak and Ivy.

Features and Labels
Features: The dataset includes various physical and chemical attributes, such as:
Cap Shape
Cap Color
Gill Size
Odor
Spore Print Color
Target Label: The classification label indicating whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
